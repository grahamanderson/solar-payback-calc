solar-payback-calc
==================

This fun project is an archive of the work I conceived and coded with some help from Nasa. Essentially, the project extracts relevant variables by regular expression from 1000's of NASA/NOAA weather station documents and generates a geo-located payback period for large ($0.5M+) commercial solar thermal installations.
